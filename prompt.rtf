Create a single-page flashcard application using Vue 3 (Composition API) and TailwindCSS v3. The app should behave like a simplified Anki. Use a local JS array as the database of words, for example: const words = [ \{ lv: "suns", en: "dog" \}, \{ lv: "ka\uc0\u311 is", en: "cat" \}, \{ lv: "maize", en: "bread" \}, \{ lv: "\u363 dens", en: "water" \} ]. On load, randomly select one word from the DB and show the Latvian word. Add a button "Show Translation" which reveals the English translation. After reveal, show two buttons: "Guessed Correctly" and "Guessed Incorrectly". Store the user\'92s selection in a statistics DB (can be a local object or array), then display a new random word. Track statistics by keeping counters for each word (correct, incorrect). Optionally display a Stats section at the bottom showing the most and least guessed words. Use components: App.vue for main layout, Flashcard.vue for handling word logic and reveal, Stats.vue for statistics display. Style with TailwindCSS v3 and provide a tailwind.config.js setup file. Keep the UI simple and elegant (centered card, responsive, minimal colors). Add optional improvements: skip word button, dark mode toggle, prevent immediate repeats, show accuracy percentage, and persist stats in localStorage.
